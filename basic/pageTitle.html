    <p>The page title is very important for search engine optimization (SEO). The text is used by search engine algorithms to decide the order when listing pages in search results.

        <br>The <title> element:
        
        defines a title in the browser toolbar
        provides a title for the page when it is added to favorites
        displays a title for the page in search engine-results
        So, try to make the title as accurate and meaningful as possible!</p>
